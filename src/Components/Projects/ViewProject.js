              <p>
                The essence of the Save The Climate Project themed "Africa is
                heating up, what are you doing about it?" is a response to the
                global climate change concern. The Climate Change Conference
                held in Glasgow, November 2021 (COP 26) have vitalized this our
                action for Africanâ€™s Climate. David Adefunmilayo (the poineer)
                being an oil and gas graduate who made a U-turn to climate
                activism, has gathered his resources and network to fight this
                climate crisis.

                This pitch deck elucidates the problems, causes and effects of
                these crisis from the African context, shows our vision for the

              <h5>Founder's story</h5>
              <p>
                David Adefunmilayo is an oil/gas graduate from Petroleum
                Training Institute and the University of Lagos. During his 400
                level internship in the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR)
                - the regulator of the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. He came
                to understand the concept of climate change, how fossil fuel
                constitutes a major effect to the crisis, and he experienced
                first-hand how flooding and many of its effects threatens the
                rights to happiness in his local communities. He then made a
                U-turn and started Efico edtech resources to help students with
                work place skills while finding his footing in driving climate
                change activism in Africa. He also joined many change-making
                communities to learn about this challenge and started designing
                an impact-driven roadmap.

              <p>
                Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the
                mid-20th century to the human expansion of the "the greenhouse
                effect" 1 - warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat
                radiating from Earth towards space
              </p>
              <p>
                Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping.
                Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere
                and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in
                temperature are described as "forcing" climate change. Gases
                such as water vapour, which respond physically or chemically to
                changes in temperature are seen as "feedbacks"
              </p>
              <p>Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:</p>

                  Global climate change has already had observable effects on
                  the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes
                  is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted
                  and trees are flowering sooner.
